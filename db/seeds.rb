Not much is known about it unluckily as almost all copies fell victim to a campaign by Gilbert Norrell to suppress it by magical means[50]. (Mr. Norrell's interference with this publication - not only irregular but perhaps illegal - was of course driven by his usual misgivings about releasing knowledge of magic to the public at large.) It can be assumed however, as the title suggests, that it is an attempt to describe all of English magic, containing mostly Strangite views. All that we are told of the book are the various quotes which appear in the footnotes of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, and its Prologue, a piece of which is published as Chapter 45 of Miss Clarke's history.", cover_url: "http://res.cloudinary.com/dybv49bau/image/upload/v1440452082/k6sluslamnswmkhgalyl.jpg", canon: "Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke", author_name: nil, author_id: nil, image600: "http://res.cloudinary.com/dybv49bau/image/upload/c_scale,w_600/v1440452082/k6sluslamnswmkhgalyl.jpg", image300: "http://res.cloudinary.com/dybv49bau/image/upload/c_scale,w_300/v1440452082/k6sluslamnswmkhgalyl.jpg", image75: "http://res.cloudinary.com/dybv49bau/image/upload/c_scale,w_75/v1440452082/k6sluslamnswmkhgalyl.jpg"},

Azif is a word the Arabs use to refer to nocturnal insects, but it is also a reference to the howling of demons (Djinn).

Minus one star because it's written in Latin through numerous demonic languages. Think a Google translate chain, but without any convenient dictionaries.

(Lay off the magicks, kids!) Anyway, this was among them, and while I found it definitely lacking in practical know-how, it made up for it by being a gateway to a horror-realm fueled by the dark deaths of an entire family line.", rating: 3},

By Their smell can men somtimes know them near, but of Their semblance can no man know, saving only in the features of those They have begotten on mankind; and of those are there many sorts, differing in likeness from man’s truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance which is Them. They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness. They bend the forest and crush the city, yet may not forest or city behold the hand that smites. Kadath in the cold waste hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath? The ice desert of the South and the sunken isles of Ocean hold stones where Their seal is engraven, but who hath seen the deep frozen city or the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed and barnacles? Great Cthulhu is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only dimly. Iä! Shub-Niggurath! As a foulness shall ye know Them. Their hand is at your throats, yet ye see Them not; and Their habitation is even one with your guarded threshold. Yog-Sothoth is the key to the gate, whereby the spheres meet.
